# Temperature Calculator

## Introduction

This project is created to show the behaviour of an element temperature during time.  
In this example the element start temperature is 100ยบ C, and the ambient temperature is 25ยบ.  
The json that contains the temperature matix was created with a discretization of the heat equation in a small program in scilab.
